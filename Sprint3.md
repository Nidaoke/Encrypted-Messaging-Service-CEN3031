# Sprint 3 Video:
    
# Progress
    From Sprint 2, the signup/login page is now more refined. 
    There is a Forget Password feature now implemented but will need further refinement. 
    A homepage that doubles as a chatroom is created and messages are now able to be sent. Additionally, the messages are able to be stored in
    the backend.
    The goal for next sprint is to be able to send/store longer messages, refine the visuals of various components, connect/route everything
    together, and hopefully get to the authentification during sign up.

# Unit Tests
## Backend
#### (UNIT) testing:
    (TBC)
## Frontend
#### Cypress Tests:
    Building off of Sprint 2's Cypress Test, this one checks to see if a user is able to login and send a message. It tests the updated login
    as well as the new homepage chat. Tester1 and Tester2 are dummy accounts made for this purpose.
#### Login Component:
    (TBC)
#### Forget Component:
    (TBC)
#### Home Component:
    This unit test is testing to see a string of max 200 characters is able to be typed and sent to a friend.
