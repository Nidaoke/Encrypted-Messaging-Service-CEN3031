# Sprint 1

## User Stories

Max: As a user, I want to be able to signup and login before I message anyone, so that I know I'm sending my messages from the right account.

Joe: As someone who cares a lot about their privacy, I want my messages to be securely encrypted so that my conversations stay hidden.

Bob: As someone who uses the same password between sites, I want to know that my login information is secure in the case that the site gets hacked.

## Issues

For the first sprint, our team wanted to solidify our idea moving forward with the project with a number of user stories to help focus our attention. We specifically targetted account creation in these steps. For our issues, following along with the user stories, we wanted to ensure the login process was complete, and that the information within was stored securely in our database. The secure storage of login information has been completed, and the login process is well on its way to being finished. There is still some issues with connecting the front to the back end but the sign-up/login page is mostly complete. The buttons work somewhat, but still needs the correct routing to a home page. We additionally wanted to begin some work on the messaging feature, but have not been able to do so yet, so this issue will remain.
