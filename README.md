# Encrypt-Me
Encrypt-Me is a messaging web application secured by end-to-end encryption up to industry standard cryptographic processes. This is the final project for the software engineering course (CEN3031) at the University of Florida.

## Project Description
Our project is an instant messaging platform where users will be able to create accounts, add friends, and send them messages. All passwords and messages will be SHA-256 encrypted within our database to ensure security. Users will be able to view their friends and see the conversations they've had with them. Features such as removing/blocking friends and deleting messages will also be available. The thematic details are to be decided.

## Technical Details
This application uses **Angular** for the front-end and **Go** for the backend. All data will be stored persistently on a **MySQL** database.
